# My Understanding of the Digital Humanities

As someone new to the Digital Humanities field this semester, my definition and understanding of it has expanded and deepened drastically over the course of these four months. Yet the sheer magnitude of Digital Humanities as its own entity in the realm of academia can be likened to Medieval Studies or Creative Writing. I could never build an exhaustive understanding of Digital Humanities. In the same way no one could read and understand every single medieval manuscript, no one could ever read and understand every project in the Digital Humanities.

Despite the oceanic amount of content to explore, I am still able to understand fundamental parts of that metaphorical ocean and how it all fits together. While at first I thought Digital Humanities was the conversion of typical Humanities content into an electronic format, I now understand the shortcomings of that definition. The Digital Humanities are capable of far more than adaptation. They are limited only by human imagination and passion for the subject, which any Humanities student will know is in no short supply.

To be more particular, my understanding of Digital Humanities changed from a narrow minded scope of transitioning popular works into the web for ease of access, into its own league of limitless possibilities for the conveyance of history, literature, and art.

## Helpful Projects

One project which built my revelation was the Digital Humanities Project Review. In it, I explored and studied a specific Digital Humanities project from a massive list of possibilities. My selection was [*Coins - A Journey Through a Rich Cultural Collection.*](https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/coins/) 

![A Pile of Digital Coins](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98109342/165566524-47d78da3-a4c0-4f34-892a-813ed5d0cb23.png)

The project presents a German museum’s collection of historical coins. Visitors are able to organize the piles to find something specific or simply explore the massive collection of over 500,000 individual coins. Apart from the collection’s impressive magnitude, the ease of access and exploration provided by the project opened my eyes.

If this project, or Digital Humanities at all, had never been built, then studying these coins would have been restricted to the incredibly patient or knowledgable. Not only would the coins need to be seen in person at the location of the collection, but someone searching for a specific coin would need to sort through the 500,000 different options. 

Even casual viewers would see only a wall of coins and perhaps small plaques under each one. But with this project, and indeed any other Digital Humanities project, the information is opened to a wider audience. The simple yet effective presentation of a rich history of money is now available to anyone, which is just one of the miracles of the platform that helped guide my understanding of Digital Humanities.

## Readings for Class

Naturally the series of readings at the start of the semester were chosen to more particularly define the Digital Humanities for students like myself. Such readings as “What is Digital Humanities” by Jason Heppler, and “A D.H. That Matters” by Matthew K. Gold and Luaren F. Klein built not only a new understanding, but a new appreciation for the Digital Humanities.

As the course went on, our readings became more focused on the given project at the time. We were to refresh ourselves on how to operate the various databases linked on our school’s library. We also had to read the incredibly helpful “Why Academics Have a Hard Time Writing Good Grant Proposals” by Robert Porter. I use this example not only because it is worth reading, but because it was assigned while we were writing grant proposals. Other relevant readings were similarly assigned in conjunction with assignments after a base of understanding was established at the semester’s start.

## My Growth as a Writer

My primary function as a writer is as a student writer. In much the same way as my understanding of Digital Humanities has expanded, my writing has also expanded. Writing on a digital platform differs greatly from academic, research writing. The blog article assignments have specific design requirements for ease of reading. I also have to incorporate basic markdown work for my blogs into the writing, and design my writing around it.

Writing for the grant was also a step in a new direction. There were similar components, such as research and persuasive writing, but applied to a new field. While I did not create the project I wrote a grant for, theorizing how I could approach it and what would be necessary also gave me insight to specific kinds of Digital Humanities writing.

The kinds of Digital Humanities writing are limitless, though. For some that may be daunting, like the massive oceans of our planet. For others, though, there’s so much left to explore.
