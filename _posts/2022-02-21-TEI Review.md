### My Experience with TEI 

The most recent Digital Humanities project I completed was to encode a section of Bram Stoker’s _Dracula’s Guest_. For this project, we used Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), which is a standardized eXtensible Markup Language (XML). Using code in this way, all aspects of the original text (misspellings included) can be digitized.

The approach to this project was slowed down and carefully crafted to make it easy for a coding beginner- such as myself- to get their feet wet. The class initially highlighted the parts of the text requiring code language within a google doc. This helped train my eye to catch aspects of the text like new paragraphs, quotes, em dashes, and page beginnings. All that remained was to apply the code itself.

When the actual coding began, we used computers provided by the school, which came equipped with the programs needed to run TEI. This was a luxury, and I am grateful that I was not required to download anything onto my personal computer, but there remained a stumbling block. The school-provided computers were Macs, and I use a PC. While the two systems are ultimately both computers, their layouts are different, so for a time I struggled to keep up. While this had no effect on my growing abilities as a coder, it did hinder my overall progress.

With a bit of help, though, I got my footing and got to coding. As pictured above, the google doc has already highlighted everything requiring a code, so the project became a simple game of copy-paste the proper code in the proper place. This I could do- and I ended up crafting an official looking chunk of code.

One piece from the project is missing though. While the copy-pasting was easy for me, I still do not entirely understand the “how” portion. Much like complicated math equations, I never really cared to understand how they work, just that they did. For future DH projects, I would like to know what is happening so that what I typed out functions properly.
