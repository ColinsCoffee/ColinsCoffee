## About me: Colin Burke  
### Family
I am happily engaged to a beautiful woman named Luna who works as an SRA at Potomac River Hall. I popped the question over the summer and we couldn't be more excited for the big day in May 2023.
We met as little kids at a karate dojo and grew up fighting each other. Lucky for me, she thought I was cute and never went too hard on me. I still have to watch out, though!

I have two older siblings, Katy and Ian. Katy works at VCU's medical hospital as an actor. She acts out conditions and illnesses which the doctors-in-training must properly diagnose and even break the news of. "Standardized Patients" are a new concept, but very valuable to the medical field.
Ian is an Intel Officer for the Navy and is stationed in San Diego. He was on the Theadore Roosevelt aircraft carrier for almost a year when the Pandemic hit.  
My parents have done an excellent job providing for all three of us and continue to be one of the greatest blessings in my life.

I have a border collie mix dog named Belle who has a firm handshake and a loud bark. She is a rescue and her past is still uncertain; it was difficult to get her acclimated to her new home at first, but she has become a very welcome addition to the family.

### Interests and Hobbies
As mentioned before, I grew up in the martial arts field. I trained in Tae Kwon Do as a kid and eventually graduated into the more adult realm of Kickboxing and practical self defense. I will always advise anyone to learn some form of self defense for their own safety and confidence. Kickboxing is not so much a practical defense method as it is a sport, but that's not a bad thing. The workouts are fantastic and getting in the ring is a thrill that can't be matched. I brought that experience with me to CNU and founded the Kickboxing Club during my Freshman year. We meet on the weekends for workouts and sparring- you should come by!  
I also get to enjoy a camping trip once or twice a year with a friend group from highschool. We rent out a cabin somewhere in the Shenandoah National Park and spend a few days in the wild. This has been a tradition for years; we even went up to the mountains over winter break. We made fires, played an out-of-tune guitar, and brewed some cowboy coffee. I promise it isn't glamping- the cabins are no-electricity, no-water buildings. Just a roof and some walls.

I am also working on a novel in the fantasy genre. I won't give too much away, of course, but it's inspired by a combination of George R.R. Martin's _Game of Thrones_ and Patrick Rothfuss' _The Name of the Wind_. It's slow going and difficult, but I hope to get it published during the summer break. Creative writing has been an outlet for me since I was in grade school, and I continue to use it today.

### Education
I am an English Major and just recently added on the Digital Humanities minor. It's no wonder that I'm here, and I'm very excited to see where this combination can take me. As a junior, I've spent a perfect amount of time in school to know CNU's campus and culture, while also not being afflicted by senioritis. I'm enjoying that pleasant middle ground while it lasts.
